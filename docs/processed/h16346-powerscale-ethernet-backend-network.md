Dell PowerScale: Ethernet Back-end Network Overview 
 
 
Legacy Isilon back-end network 
 
Before the introduction of the latest generation of PowerScale scale-out NAS storage 
platforms, inter-node communication in a Dell Isilon cluster was performed using a 
proprietary, unicast (node-to-node) protocol known as Remote Block Manager (RBM). 
This inter-node communication uses a fast low-latency InfiniBand (IB) network. This back-
end network, which is configured with redundant switches for high availability, acts as the 
backplane for the Isilon cluster. This backplane enables each Isilon node to act as a 
contributor in the cluster and provides node-to-node communication with a private, high-
speed, low-latency network. This back-end network uses Internet Protocol (IP) over IB 
(IPoIB) to manage the cluster. Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) is used for all data traffic 
between nodes in the cluster. 
Isilon platform back-end network option 
 
Isilon scale-out NAS platforms offer increased back-end networking flexibility. With 
PowerScale platforms, customers may choose to use either an InfiniBand or Ethernet 
switch on the back end. For customers electing to use an InfiniBand back-end network, 
the configuration and implementation will remain the same as previous generations of 
Isilon systems. Customers looking to add Isilon platforms (Isilon F800/F810, H600, 
H5600, H500, H400, A200, and A2000) to an existing Isilon IB cluster that consisted of 
earlier Isilon systems must configure the nodes with an InfiniBand back-end interface. The 
Ethernet back-end network option is only supported in clusters that consist entirely of 
Ethernet back-end nodes. In these configurations, only Ethernet back-end switches that 
are provided and managed by Dell are supported. 
The PowerScale Ethernet back-end connection options are detailed in the following table: 
Table 1.

Isilon A200, or Isilon A2000 
 
Note: Dell does not support connecting any other devices to the back-end switches.

Notes:  
The same NIC supports both 25 GbE and 10 GbE for the F210, F200, H700, H7000, A300, 
A3000, P100, and B100. The same NIC supports both 100 GbE and 40 GbE for the F210, F710, 
F910, F200, F600, F900, H700, H7000, A300, A3000, P100, and B100. The NIC speed change is 
achieved by using different transceivers or cables. 
The F910, F710, F210, F200, P100, and B100 nodes do not support a 25 GbE back-end 
connection if they are configured with 100 GbE front-end connectivity. 
New-generation PowerScale platforms with different back-end speeds can connect to the 
same switch with Isilon nodes (Isilon F800, H600, H5600, H500, H400, A200, and A2000) 
and not see performance issues. Consider the example of a mixed cluster of an archive 
node (such as A200 or A2000) with 10 GbE on the back end and PowerScale nodes with 
40 GbE or 100 GbE on the back end. In such clusters, both node types can connect to a 
100 GbE back-end switch without affecting the performance of other nodes on the switch. 
The 100 GbE back-end switch will provide 100 GbE to the ports servicing the high-
performance PowerScale nodes and 10 GbE to the archive or lower performing nodes 
using breakout cables. 
 
In legacy versions of Isilon OneFS, back-end data traffic uses SDP and IPoIB for 
management. SDP has fast failover and incorporates various InfiniBand-only features that 
ensure optimum performance. However, because SDP only works over InfiniBand, a new 
method was required to get optimal performance over the Ethernet back end. For this 
reason, the new generation of PowerScale platforms now uses RBM over TCP on the 
back-end switches.

Dell PowerScale: Ethernet Back-end Network Overview 
RBM now uses TCP, and the TCP stack has been enhanced to provide the performance 
required to support the cluster communication. All the modifications of the TCP stack have 
been made while conforming to the industry standard specification of the stack. The back-
end and front-end networks will use the same TCP stack and modifications to the 
performance of the back-end TCP stack should not affect TCP traffic on the front end. 
RBM over Ethernet will still provide fast failover. 
Please note that starting from OneFS 9.10, PowerScale platforms also supports 
InfiniBand back end on F210, F710, F910. 
 
When installing a new Isilon cluster, the Configuration Wizard has not changed. It still 
prompts you for int-a, int-b, and failover range. All configuration and setup steps will be 
the same regardless of InfiniBand or Ethernet option selected.  
The following figures show the relative positioning of back-end ports provided in the 
Compute Assembly for each Dell PowerScale/Isilon platform node type.

Note: Customers should not attempt to alter the back-end network configurations provided by 
Dell. Any attempt to do so can result in a cluster-wide outage.  
For SNMP capabilities, a customer may send an SNMP alert through the CELOG system. 
In today’s back-end Ethernet world, we no longer have opensm topology files to view all 
connected devices on the back-end network. If you want to know what is connected to the 
fabric of back-end Ethernet (int-a or int-b), you can use the isi_dump_fabric int-a 
(or int-b) command. 
 
Following are examples of cluster configurations with varying node types and the 
corresponding back-end connectivity infrastructure. 
Example 1: All-performance Dell PowerScale 100 GbE back end
