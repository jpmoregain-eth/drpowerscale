Web Browser - OneFS
The OneFS web interface supports most modern web browsers with JavaScript, cookies, and SSL enabled.
The OneFS web interface was tested with the following web browsers. Exercise caution before using an unsupported browser.
Table 3. Browser Compatibility 
Browser

Chrome
Use the latest stable version of Chrome.
Firefox
Use the latest stable version of Firefox.
Microsoft Edge
Use the latest stable version of Microsoft Edge.
NOTE: The OneFS web interfaces are best viewed at a screen resolution of 1024*768.
Upgrading PowerScale OneFS
Upgrading OneFS can be done using either the web interface or the command-line interface and includes a series of tasks that 
Administrators must perform before, during, and after the upgrade. There are two options available for upgrading your OneFS 
cluster: parallel upgrades or simultaneous upgrades.
If you have Dell Technologies connectivity services enabled, when the cluster is upgraded to PowerScale OneFS 9.13.0.0, the 
legacy (XML) based license is automatically migrated to Dynamic Licensing.
In PowerScale OneFS 9.12.0.0 and later versions, if you have Dell Technologies connectivity services enabled, the PowerScale 
OneFS cluster can subscribe to upgrade notifications. Available upgrade package names and information are managed by Dell 
Technologies according to cluster telemetry data and are automatically displayed in the WebUI. You can configure OneFS 
to automatically download the available upgrade packages and install them with one click from the WebUI or command-line 
interface. More information is in the PowerScale OneFS Upgrade Planning and Process Guide.
NOTE: In PowerScale OneFS 9.11.0.0 and later versions, Dell Technologies recommends parallel nondisruptive upgrades. 
Rolling upgrades are deprecated in PowerScale OneFS 9.11.0.0 and later.
For more information about how to plan, prepare, and perform an upgrade on your OneFS cluster, see the PowerScale OneFS 
Upgrade Planning and Process Guide.

Node Pool Compatibility
Node pool compatibility enables deployment of a newer generation node to a SmartPools node pool that contains nodes from an 
earlier generation.
If the nodes are compatible, you can join a newer generation node to an existing cluster of earlier generation nodes. The newer 
generation node becomes a member of an existing node pool.
For node pool compatibility, the following requirements must be met:
●
The newer-generation node must have the same node series as the earlier-generation node (S, X, A, or F).
●
The newer-generation node must have the same number and layout of HDDs, SEDs, and SSDs as the earlier-generation 
node.
●
If the two conditions above are met, nodes with different RAM capacities can be in the same node pool, and mixed‑memory 
configurations are supported.
Hardware

nodes that have fewer than 16 SSDs and at least a 2:1 ratio of HDDs to SSDs. If SSDs are used for storage, then SSD 
counts must be identical on all nodes in a node pool or performance might be impacted.
